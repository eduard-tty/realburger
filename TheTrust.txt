======================================

An Over the Edge adventure that might be finished in 1 session if your
lucky.

Campaign background
-------------------

It's 1997. The characters who are between 18 and 27 have been called
to Al Amarja by a solicitor o receive a mysterious inheritance. They
were all born though artificial insemination and man who dies is there
genetic father.  He has fathered a lot more children but picks the
characters to runs a trust that aims to take care of all his
progeny. This is the basis for a campaign.

The first adventure starts with them having to wait and then having
their flight upgraded to first class. They are taken to Al Amarja
together with Angelia Reyes and can get to know her on the plain. They
arrive at the airport and check in to the EZ sleep, because they are
low on funds. There {Character 4} is implanted with a transceiver that
broadcasts whatever he sees and even thinks. And all that is turned
into a reality TV show(Trueman show); thought are only heard by paying
customers. They also accidentally leave what amounts to a
flashlight/light-saber in the hackers room.

After meeting the solicitor and being installed as a board for the
trust. The solicitor still controls the money. They find out the
reality TV show with {Character 4}; The Real Burger(TRB).

Plot
----

### Intro

They all receive a letter requesting their presence at the reading of a will of a man claiming
to be their father with a plain ticket included. Then meat each other in the plain to Al Amarja.

### Twist 1: Cameras

As they are waiting in line at customs, just after Angela Reyes has gone though. Customs close
for the day. They have to wait and while they sleep at E-Z Sleep 2.0, a camera is implanted in
each characters brain and the light-saber is left by accident.

### Increase tension 1: Dog faces

Investigator will know to go to the Solicitors office:

    David Coldburn, Solicitor
    Four-points; 
    1201 Pogrom Lane

Before they arrive they will meet a dog face patrol, directed by a Kergillian operator that
threatens to beat them up unless they turn over the light-saber.

### Increase tension 2: See TV show
 
Characters see themselves on a television as they pass Dmitri's Fix-It shop. They can hear
themselfs too as they look at the end of the encounter with the dog faces. The show quickly
catches up and now the tv shows them watching the TV with the Droste Effect(this may embue tv with
special properties).

### Increase tension 3: Refuse reading of will

The characters enter David Coldburns office, again seeing themselfs on television, though without
sound this time. David will explain a little about Hary Lynch, but he refuses to read the will
untill they can have a little privacy. 

### Darkest moment: How to get rid of the show

The characters need to sit down and think. They need a way to get of the TV show. Medic might need
some meat. Investigator needs to know whats goin on.

- Driver has a package to deliver that also needs privacy. She might ask for help from The Net,
  for a price, deliver another package to the piece force.
- Hacker might get on the internet and follow the live stream thats also being broadcast. 
- DMitri can build something to trace the signal from their heads to the studio.
- They might go to the peace force or Dr. Nusbaum and he will help them to remove the transciever
  for a price. 
- They might return to EZ Sleep 2.0 and find the person who did the implants
- Investigator might ask contacts at the paper where to go next.
- Get fans to search for the studio 

At some later point the characters may hear their thoughts on television to increase paranoia.

### Way out: They get a tracer

Dimitri from Dimitri's Fix-It can sell them something to trace the signal back to the source.
David Coldburn migth call them and ask to meet them at Sad Mary's and give them two.

They will get two so they can triangulate if they think of it.

### Climax: At the studio

Small building in Broken Wings, houses a alien tec TV studio.  Inside
they find Ali Trueman, a tortured rogue kergillian artist. The
director of The Real Burger. They may tralk him into removing the
trancievers. When they have talked to him for a while a high beep
sounds and a counter on the studio(in a suitcase) starts to run down
from some some number in kergillian digets. 

Tray tells them the studio and the trancievers will blow up in a few
minutes he might do someting quick to disable them but he's not sure
it will work so they should get as far away as possible and maybe
they'll be out of range. He also ads a counter to a smartphone of
able, but it's in Kergillian digits and units of time.

### Wind-down: Reading of the will 

When they are far enough away the counter stops an a big explosion
happens where teh studio was. A single body is found, but is one looks
closely it's nothing like teh man they talked to.

They are no longer on TV and the will can be read. They are to run a
trust together with David Coldburn to find and take care of all of
Harry Lynch's children. The recieve a decent salery.

Goal
----

To stop the TV show without being kidnapped by Aliens.
