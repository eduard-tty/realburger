Description

Australian Trainee doctor 

that did some unauthorized experiments that
got a patient killed. The police and the medical review board are
looking for him. He did develop a drug that will regenerate a persons
cells, but it leaves them needing to eat a lot of meat. He used this
drug on himself and he needs a portion of meat for every 5 hit points
he loses if a doesn't his body will start feeding on itself and he
will not heal at all white feeling terribly hungry.
