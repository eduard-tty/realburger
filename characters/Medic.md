Drives
------
- Medical experimentation
- Find Dr. Alfonse Rodriguez

Motivation to stay in Al Amarja
-------------------------------

Immunity from prosecution and freedom to experiment medically restrained only by his own ethics
and it is the last known location of Dr. Rodriguez.

Secret
------

Developed a treatment that makes cells regenerate much faster. 

First he tried it on some patients in secret. Partly because he though it was their only hope and
partly because he just wanted to know if it would work. Sadly one of these patenients died and he
is currently wanted for questioning by the police and the medical review board in Australia.

Then he tried it on himself. Now he heals much fater, but in order to heal he needs to eat more
meat. Each normal portion of meat heals 5 hit points. Of course there is a limit to how quickly
his body can process meat.

Important Person
----------------

Dr. Alfonse Rodriguez. The notes he found one day on a discarded flash drive made his invention
possible and James is sure that with his help he could make it much more effective.
